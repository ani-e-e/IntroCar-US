      "title": "Removing Driveshaft Flange from Hub",
      "description": "The drive shaft flanges on Rolls-Royce Silver Shadows (T type) and early Silver Spirits, Spurs (Bentley Turbo, Brooklands, Mulsanne, Eight) are fixed to the stub axle on the hub, with a taper and woodruff key. The nut is tightened to 500lbft which means the flange requires a lot of pulling force to remove it. This is hard without the correct puller.\n\nIf the flange nut is not tightened enough, when torque is applied to the through driveshaft, the flange will spin on the taper breaking the woodruff key, The nuts have a right hand thread on both sides. This means that if the right hand spins, it will undo the nut and the driveshaft will just spin, damaging the flange and the stub axle without turning the wheel. If it happens on the left hand side, when the flange turns and the key breaks, it can tighten the nut making it very hard to undo and also increasing the force on the flange to the stub axle making it even harder to remove the flange. \n\nThis video details the technique used to remove the driveshaft flange from the hub.",

      "description": "We are proud to announce the upcoming release of our Prestige Parts® replacement for the discontinued Bentley V8 Cylinder Head Gasket, for Rolls-Royce and Bentley V8 engines manufactured 1959 to 2002. Three and a half years in the making, this project represents one of our most expensive and advanced products to date, incorporating state-of-the-art design, tooling, and manufacturing techniques.\n\nIn this video John takes an in depth look at the function and design of the new head gasket versus the original Bentley Motors gasket, including how the design affects performance. \n\nThe Prestige Parts® Cylinder Head Gasket (07V103147.01-X) includes enhancements that alleviate limitations caused by use of the Bentley gasket in applications for which it was not strictly intended. The original Bentley gasket was designed for use in brand new, lower performance engines, but the Prestige Parts gasket incorporates additional features appropriate to the wide range of vehicle applications for which it is now required.\n\nApplication: This gasket is suitable for all Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles manufactured from 1959 to 2002 (excluding Silver Seraph and Arnage equipped with BMW engine; Arnage R; Arnage RL & Arnage T models).",
